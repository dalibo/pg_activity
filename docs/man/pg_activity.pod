=head1 NAME

pg_activity - Realtime PostgreSQL database server monitoring tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_activity> [option..] [connection string]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command line tool for PostgreSQL server activity monitoring.

pg_activity must run on the same server as the instance and
as the user running the instance (or root) to show
CPU, MEM, READ or WRITE columns and other system information.

=head2 THE HEADER

The first line of the header displays PostgreSQL's version, the host name, the
connection string, the refresh rate and the duration mode.

The header is then divided in tree groups: B<instance>, B<worker processes>,
B<system>.  The information is filtered according to the filter parameters when
appropriate. This is shown in the following descriptions with the "(filtered)"
mention. Depending on the version you are on, some information might not be
available. In that case, it will be replaced by a dash.

The B<instance> group displays information aubout the PostgreSQL instance (or
cluster). This group can be displayed or hidden with the I Key.

Global :

=over 2

=item - B<uptime>: since when is the instance running;

=item - B<dbs size>: total size of the databases (filtered);

=item - B<growth>: groth in B/s of the databases (filtered);

=item - B<cache hit ratio>: the percentage of page read from the PostgreSQL's cache (filtered).

=back

Sessions :

=over 2

=item - B<total>: session count (filtered) / max_connections;

=item - B<active>: number of active sessions (filtered);

=item - B<idle>: number of idle sessions (filtered);

=item - B<idle in txn>: number of sessions who are in the idle in transaction state (filtered);

=item - B<idle in txn abrt>: number of sessions who are in the idle in transaction aborted state (filtered);

=item - B<waiting>: number of sessions that are waiting for a lock (filtered).

=back

Activity :

=over 2

=item - B<tps>: transaction per second (sum of commit & rollback for all databases / time elapsed since last snapshot) (filtered);

=item - B<insert/s>: number of inserts per second (filtered);

=item - B<updates/s>: number of updates per second (filtered);

=item - B<delete/s>: number of deletes per second (filtered);

=item - B<tuples returned/s>: number of tuples returned per second (filtered);

=item - B<temp files>: number of temporary files created on the instance;

=item - B<temp size>: total temporary file size on the instance.

=back

The B<worker processes> group displays information about backgroup workers,
autovacuum processes, wal senders and wal receivers. It also gives information
about replication slots. Except for the autovacuum workers count, most of this
information is not related to a specific database, therefore their values will
be zero when the data is filtered.

Worker processes:

=over 2

=item - B<total>: total worker count / maximum number of worker slots, parallel workers and logical replication wokers are taken from this amount (filtered);

=item - B<logical wokers>: logical replication worker count / maximum number of logical replication wokers (filtered);

=item - B<parallel workers>: parallel worker count for maintenance & queries / maximum number of parallel workers (filtered).

=back

Other processes & information:

=over 2

=item - B<autovacuum workers>: number of autovacuum worker in action / maximum number of autovacuum workers (filtered);

=item - B<wal senders>: number of wal senders / maximum number of wal senders processes (filtered);

=item - B<wal receivers>: number of wal receivers / maximum number of wal receiver processes (filtered);

=item - B<repl. slots>: number of replication slots / maximum number of replication slots (filtered).

=back

The last group displays B<system information>:

=over 2

=item - B<Mem.>: total / free / used and buff+cached memory with the related percentages;

=item - B<Swap>: total / free / used swap;

=item - B<IO>: the number of IO per second, current Read and Write thoughput (aggregated data gathered with the psutil library);

=item - B<Load>: CPU load for the last 1, 5, 15 minutes;

=back

=head2 THE RUNNING QUERIES PANEL

The running queries panel shows all running queries, transactions or backends 
(depending on the B<DURATION_MODE> setting) which have lasted for more than
B<min duration> seconds. It displays the following information:

=over 2

=item - B<DATABASE>: database specified in the connection string;

=item - B<APP>: application name specified in the connection string;

=item - B<READ/s>:  read thruput as reported by the psutil library;

=item - B<WRITE/s>: write thruput as reported by the psutil library;

=item - B<TIME>: time since the beginning of the query / transaction / backend start depending on the B<DURATION_MODE> currently in use;

=item - B<Waiting>: for PostgreSQL 9.6+: a specific wait event or nothing. Otherwise, a boolean indicating if we are waiting for a Lock;

=item - B<state>: state of the backend;

=item - B<Query>: the query.
