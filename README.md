Installation from packages (recommended)
----------------------------------------

pg\_activity is available in many Linux distributions; the PostgreSQL Global
Development Group (PGDG) also provides packages for RPM-based
(https://yum.postgresql.org/) and Debian-based distributions
(https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt):

    $ sudo yum install pg_activity

    $ sudo apt install pg-activity

Using distribution packages is the recommended way to install pg\_activity.

Installation from pip
---------------------

Alternatively, pg\_activity can be installed using pip on Python 3.7 or later
along with psycopg2 (version 2.8 or higher):

    $ python3 -m pip install pg_activity psycopg2-binary

In case your `$PATH` does not already contain it, the full path is:

    $ ~/.local/bin/pg_activity

Installation from the git repository
------------------------------------

This is only necessary to test development versions. First, clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dalibo/pg_activity.git

Change the branch if necessary. Then create a dedicated environment,
install dependencies and then pg\_activity from the repo:

    $ cd pg_activity
    $ python3 -m venv .venv
    $ . .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install psycopg2-binary .
    (.venv) $ pg_activity

To quit this env and destroy it:

    $ deactivate
    $ rm -r .venv

Usage
-----

`pg_activity` works locally or remotely. In local execution context, to obtain
sufficient rights to display system information, the system user running
`pg_activity` must be the same user running postgresql server (`postgres` by
default), or have more rights like `root`. Otherwise, `pg_activity` can fallback
to a degraded mode without displaying system information. On the same way,
PostgreSQL user used to connect to the database must be super-user.
ex:

    sudo -u postgres pg_activity -U postgres

Notes
-----

Length of SQL query text that `pg_activity` reports relies on PostgreSQL
parameter `track_activity_query_size`. Default value is `1024` (expressed in
bytes). If your SQL query text look truncated, you should increase
`track_activity_query_size`.

FAQ
---

**I can't see my queries only TPS is shown**

`pg_activity` scans the view `pg_stat_activity` with a user defined refresh
time comprised between 0.5 and 5 seconds. It can be modified in the interface
with the `+` and `-` keys. Any query executed between two scans won't be
displayed.


What is more, `pg_activity` uses different queries to get :

*    settings from `pg_settings`
*    version info using `version()`
*    queries and number of connections from `pg_stat_activity`
*    locks from `pg_locks`
*    tps from `pg_database` using `pg_stat_get_db_xact_commit()` and
     `pg_stat_get_db_xact_rollback()`
*    and more ( eg : `pg_cancel_backend()` and `pg_terminate_backend()` )

Those queries cannot be seen in the query tab because all queries issued from
the `pg_activity` backend are considered as noise and are not displayed . On
the other hand, the transactions used to get the info for `pg_activity`'s
reporting are still accounted for by postgres in `pg_stat_get_db_xact_commit()`
and `pg_stat_get_db_xact_commit()`. Therefore `pg_activity` will display a non
zero TPS even with no activity on the database, and/or no activity displayed on
screen.

**How can I specify a password for authentication ?**

pg_activity uses libpq to access to PostgreSQL therefore all the traditional
methods are available.

You can pass the password for the database connection in a password file.
Information can also be given via PostgreSQL's environment variables
(PGPASSFILE or PGPASSWORD) or via the connection string parameters.

The password file is preferred since it's more secure (security is deferred to
the OS). Please avoid password in connection strings at all cost.
