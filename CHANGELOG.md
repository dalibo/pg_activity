# Change log

## pg\_activity 3.6.0 - UNRELEASED

### Added

* The color of cells in the process table can now be customized through the
  configuration file.

### Fixed

* Fix configuration of the color of `appname` column (#415).

### Changed

* Exit with status 0 upon keyboard interrupt.

## pg\_activity 3.5.1 - 2024-04-03

### Fixed

* Resolve a warning about usage of a deprecated Python `datetime` API from
  Python 3.12.
* Resolve setuptools warnings about packages 'pgactivity.profiles' and
  'pgactivity.queries' being absent from `packages` configuration by getting
  back to setuptools "automatic discovery" (#411).

### Misc

* Turn Python warnings into errors when running the test suite.

## pg\_activity 3.5.0 - 2024-03-01

### Added

* The *rollback ratio* is now displayed in the "global" header (#385).
* Make header's sections display configurable through the `[header]` section of
  the configuration file.
* Configuration profiles can now be defined at
  `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:~/.config}/pg_activity/<profile>.conf` or
  `/etc/pg_activity/<profile>.conf` as selected from the command line through
  `--profile <profile>`.
  Some built-in profiles are distributed with pg\_activity.

### Changed

* The help text for `K` action, displayed in the footer, has been rephrased as
  "terminate underlying session".
* Rephrase the help text of `--no-{inst,sys,proc}-info` options and group them
  into a dedicated section of `--help` output.

### Fixed

* At startup, do not show a traceback upon failure to connect to PostgreSQL.
* Fix password prompt not shown with psycopg2 backend.
* Fix retrieval of I/O statistics on BSD systems (#393).
* Fix spelling mistakes in the man page.

### Removed

* Python 3.7 is no longer supported.

### Misc

* Document how to *hack* on pg\_activity in the `README`.
* Add a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration.
* Require psycopg >= 3.1 (when using the psycopg backend) to get a more robust
  detection of connection password need.

## pg\_activity 3.4.2 - 2023-06-01

### Fixed

* Fix package installation by not installing `tests` and `docs` directories
  (#378).

## pg\_activity 3.4.1 - 2023-05-30

### Fixed

* Add more compatibility for old attr versions (#376).

## pg\_activity 3.4.0 - 2023-05-15

### Added

* Improve rendering of the `client` column by possibly abbreviating IP
  addresses.
* Add support for configuring pg\_activity from a configuration file in INI
  format and installed at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:~/.config}/pg_activity.conf` or
  `/etc/pg_activity.conf`.
* Determine which columns to hide from reading the configuration file (`hidden =
  yes|no` option).
* Determine columns width from the configuration file (`width = <positive
  integer>` option).

### Fixed

* Fix a crash when trying to reconnect.

### Misc.

* Move packaging metadata to `pyproject.toml`.

## pg\_activity 3.3.0 - 2023-03-22

### Fixed

* Replace the previous header column separator (`â‹…`) by a comma to improve user
  experience in situations where that character did not render well (#356,
  #230).

## pg\_activity 3.2.0 - 2023-03-15

### Fixed

* Handle conversion between PostgreSQL encoding names and Python ones while
  decoding the `query` column from `pg_stat_activity` with
  `pg_database.encoding` (#348).

* Fix typos in man pages, spotted by codespell.

### Added

* When using the psycopg backend, set `client_encoding` to `auto` if unspecified
  in the connection string. This will help getting the appropriate client
  encoding from locale settings, even if the connection database has a different
  one.

* Fall back to a permissive-but-hopefully-more-robust loader for character type
  values if client encoding is really `ascii`, when using the psycopg backend.

### Misc.

* Add compatibility with old humanize (>= 0.5.1), to make packaging easier on
  old platforms such as RHEL 8.

* Adjust log messages prefix, removing the "Hint" word and adding the level
  name, as we now emit messages for different purposes.

## pg\_activity 3.1.1 - 2023-03-06

### Fixed

* Fix crash on startup with no "connection string" argument and the psycopg
  backend #346.

## pg\_activity 3.1.0 - 2023-03-01

### Added

* Add support for Psycopg 3 database driver, as an alternative to psycopg2.
  Packagers and users installing from `pip` are encouraged to install the
  `psycopg` dependency instead of psycopg2.
* Add `psycopg` and `psycopg2` setuptools extras to ease complete installation
  from pip.
* Prepare statements for execution when using the `psycopg` database driver for
  better performance.

### Fixed

* Rework decoding of the `query` column to (hopefully) make it more robust
  (see #149 for the original report, #302 for a new problem raised while fixing
  the previous one and #332 for the latest update).
* Fix a few typos in the man page.

### Misc.

* Add a change log file and update the release how-to accordingly.
* Use [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check
  misspellings.
* Add Project-URLs core metadata for Python packaging.
* Install the project in *develop* mode in Tox test environment.
* Require blessed >= 1.15.0, as earlier versions are not compatible with Python
  3.7.
